# DouglasVDM-Cloud-Module-Week-2-Challenge

# Notes on the challenges
    * Internal API is more secure, a bit more complex though (...@Harry Li recommends it, if you can implement it)
    * There's a lot of examples out there for Free Tier applications, read that up 1st to understand the concept
    * Do an architectural diagram, it's recommended. Look-up "How to do a diagram" AWS has their own logo's. It's a professional way to present an infrastructure
    
# Day 01

1. Started reading blog posts, I found [How to Deploy and Automate Projects with AWS Free Tier — Part 1](https://aws.plainenglish.io/part-1-design-how-to-deploy-and-automate-your-projects-with-aws-free-tier-79eeab5fff62) to be an interesting read. Didn't understand the majority of the contents but put it in my head anyway. I was hooked when I saw there's a **Sample Project**!
2. Next article on my list is [How You Can Use AWS Free Tier — Cloud Compute](https://www.msp360.com/resources/blog/aws-free-tier-ec2-lambda/). It also contains **example projects**, which is what I'm looking for.
3. Some of the more popular use cases for the cloud

|Use case|Descripttion|
|----|----|
|Saas (Software as a Service)| Delivering a single application through a web browser to thousands of customers using a multitenant architecture.
|Utility Computing| This form of cloud computing is getting new life from Amazon, Sun, IBM, and others who now offer storage and virtual servers that IT can access on demand.|
|Web Services in the Cloud| Closely related to SaaS, Web service providers offer APIs that enable developers to exploit functionality over the Internet, rather than delivering full-blown applications|
|Platform-as-a-Service| This form of cloud computing delivers development environments as a service. You build your own applications that run on the provider’s infrastructure and are delivered to your users via the Internet from the provider’s servers.|
|MSP (Managed Service Providers)| One of the oldest forms of cloud computing, a managed service is basically an application exposed to IT rather than to end-users, such as a virus scanning service for e-mail or an application monitoring service.|
|Service Commerce Platforms| A hybrid of SaaS and MSP, this cloud computing service offers a service hub that users interact with. They’re most common in trading environments.|
