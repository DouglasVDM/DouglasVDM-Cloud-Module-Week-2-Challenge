# DouglasVDM-Cloud-Module-Week-2-Challenge

# Notes on the challenges
    * Internal API is more secure, a bit more complex though (...@Harry Li recommends it, if you can implement it)
    * There's a lot of examples out there for Free Tier applications, read that up 1st to understand the concept
    * Do an architectural diagram, it's recommended. Look-up "How to do a diagram" AWS has their own logo's. It's a professional way to present an infrastructure
